This directory contains data and script to calibrate Pyrene robot using
  - April tags attached to the wrist, and
  - the RGB-D camera mounted on the head.

Directory data contains configurations for which, the left or right wrist is
visible from the camera. File "all-configurations.csv" is ordered using a naive
traveller salesman solution.

script "script_hpp.py" generate a list of collision-free paths going
from the first configuration to the last one. Using options, this script
can also generate such configurations.

File "demo.launch" run the simulation using ROS. The command is

  roslaunch agimus_demos talos_calibration_apriltags.launch

File "play_motion.py" triggers execution of the paths planned by hppcorbaserver.

File "compute_calibration.py" solves the optimization problem that provide the
calibration parameters.
